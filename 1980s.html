<h2><center>Commodore introduces the VIC-20</center></h2>
<p><center>Commodore releases the VIC-20 home computer as the successor to the Commodore PET personal computer. Intended to be a less expensive alternative to the PET, the VIC-20 was highly successful, becoming the first computer to sell more than a million units. Commodore even used Star Trek television star William Shatner in advertisements.</center></p>

<h2><center>Texas Instruments TI 99/4 is released</center></h2>
<p><center>Based around the Texas Instruments TMS 9900 microprocessor running at 3 MHz, the TI 99/4 has one of the fastest CPUs available in a home computer. The TI99/4 had a wide variety of expansion boards, with an especially popular speech synthesis system that could also be used with TI's Speak & Spell educational game. The TI 99/4 sold well and led to a series of TI follow-on machines.</center>

<h2><center>IBM releases the first commercial RISC-based workstation</center></h2>
<p><center>Reduced instruction set computers (RISC) grow out of the observation that the simplest 20 percent of a computerÂ´s instruction set does 80 percent of the work. The IBM PC-RT had 1 MB of RAM, a 1.2-megabyte floppy disk drive, and a 40 MB hard drive. It performed 2 million instructions per second, but other RISC-based computers worked significantly faster.</center>
